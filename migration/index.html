						Migration FAQ&rsquo;s for sitters new to Rover
					</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>What is happening with DogVacay and Rover?</strong>
						On May 1, all United States DogVacay hosts and sitters were invited to migrate their profiles to Rover, which can be done with just a few clicks. You&rsquo;ll still be able to manage existing bookings on DogVacay, but we encourage you to manage your business on Rover—that way, all your info will live in one place. After June 12, you can continue creating new bookings on Rover, but you will no longer be able to create new bookings on DogVacay and will be redirected to complete the booking on Rover.
					</p>
					<div class="dv-no-roverlap-intro">
						<p>
							<b>Why migrate?</b> By migrating over to Rover, you&rsquo;ll have access to better tools, more business, and you&rsquo;ll receive the same world-class support you&rsquo;ve come to know and love. We&rsquo;re combining our resources to invest in the dog people who make our communities so vibrant.
						</p>
					</div>
					<small class="dv-no-roverlap-intro-micro">
						All Canadian sitters and owners will be invited to migrate starting May 16. Until then, please continue to use DogVacay as usual.

								Why are DogVacay and Rover coming together?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									Rover and DogVacay share the same mission: To make life better for dogs and the people who love them. We can make an even bigger impact together. This union will make it easier for pet parents to get trusted care for their dogs, for pet sitters to connect with more dog owners nationwide, and most importantly, for dogs to get the best neighborhood care.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 id="dv-question-2">
								What is Rover?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									Rover is the nation&rsquo;s largest network of 5-star pet sitters and dog walkers. Similar to DogVacay, Rover connects pet parents with people who will treat their dogs like family. As a Rover sitter, you&rsquo;ll still be able to choose your schedule, services, and rates, and continue to build your own pet-sitting business.

								What does &ldquo;migration&rdquo; mean?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What does &ldquo;migration&rdquo; mean?
									</strong>
									Migration is the quick and easy process of moving your DogVacay profile to the Rover platform. When you activate your new Rover profile, it&rsquo;ll have all the information from your DogVacay profile along with your DogVacay reviews, messages, and bookings (past, current, and future).
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What happens to my DogVacay profile once I migrate?
									</strong>
									Your DogVacay profile will remain active even after you migrate, and you&rsquo;ll still be able to manage your existing bookings on DogVacay. Starting June 12, you&rsquo;ll no longer be able to accept bookings on DogVacay.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										I&rsquo;m a sitter in Canada, what does this mean for me?
									</strong>
									All Canadian sitters will be invited to migrate starting May 16. Until then, please continue to use DogVacay as usual.
								</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 id="dv-question-4">
								What comes over with me?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Reviews and Profile Information
									</strong>
									All of your reviews and profile information from DogVacay will be transferred to your Rover profile once you activate it.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Past, current, and future bookings
									</strong>
									You&rsquo;ll be able to view all of your past, current, and future DogVacay bookings on Rover. Any bookings accepted on DogVacay will still be paid out through DogVacay.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Messages with customers
									</strong>
									All of your messages with past and current customers will appear on your Rover profile when you migrate. If you continue to send messages from your DogVacay profile after May 1, those messages will also appear on your Rover profile.
									<br><br>
									Messages you send from your Rover profile after May 1 will <b>not</b> appear on your DogVacay profile.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Services and Rates
									</strong>
									Your current DogVacay service offerings and rates will be transferred to your Rover profile.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Sitter Fee Percentage
									</strong>
									You will keep your current sitter fee percentage when you activate your Rover profile.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Booking Preferences
									</strong>
									Your booking preferences will be transferred to your Rover profile. We encourage you to double-check these once you activate your profile.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Calendar Availability
									</strong>
									Your calendar availability from DogVacay will be transferred to Rover once you claim your profile. With Rover&rsquo;s calendar, you can set availability per service. <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/206004606-How-do-I-manage-my-calendar-" target="_blank">This article</a> provides information on how to do so.

								What&rsquo;s the impact on my business?

							<div>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What happens to my sitter fee percentage?
									</strong>
									You will keep your current sitter fee percentage when you activate your Rover profile.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How will my position in search be impacted?
									</strong>
									All of the great work you&rsquo;ve been doing on DogVacay will go with you to Rover! Things like your DogVacay booking rate, repeat guest rate, and reviews will all be factored into your search position on Rover. <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/202838454-How-do-I-improve-my-position-in-search-results-" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about how your search score is calculated on Rover.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How will I receive payment?
									</strong>
									After you migrate, your payout preferences will remain the same. For example, if you&rsquo;re normally paid out via PayPal on DogVacay, you&rsquo;ll be paid out via PayPal on Rover.
									<br><br>
									The payout timing will change, however. You&rsquo;ll receive your payout on Rover <b>two calendar days</b> after the completion of a booking, even on weekends and holidays. For example, a booking ending on a Friday will be paid out on Sunday. 
									<br><br>
									Migrated sitters will be opted into automatic transfers, but on Rover, you also have the ability to build up a balance and withdraw funds manually. To learn more about the payment process, we suggest <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/202838244-How-do-I-get-paid-for-bookings-and-when-" target="_blank">this article</a>.
									<br><br>
									Please note that in the near term, bookings accepted on DogVacay will still be paid out by DogVacay and will follow the preferences you set on your DogVacay profile.
									<br><br>
									Canadian services will continue to be listed and paid in Canadian dollars. Note: Canadian sitters will be paid out via PayPal only. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Will I still be able to send custom quotes?
									</strong>
									Yes, but it works a little differently.
									<br><br>
									If a customer has never booked with you before, they must first send you a booking request. You can then edit the rate and send the request back, and they&rsquo;ll confirm the amended request.
									<br><br>
									If a customer has booked with you before, you may initiate the reservation request and adjust the rate as you see fit.
									<br><br>
									You can read more about this process <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/206355373-How-do-I-edit-stay-dates-and-price-" target="_blank">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Should I update my rate?
									</strong>
									Once you activate your Rover profile, we recommend checking the rates of similar sitters in your area to ensure you&rsquo;re competitive. You also have the option of customizing holiday rates if you&rsquo;d like to do so. <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/208655356-How-do-I-add-cat-care-and-other-add-on-services-to-my-profile-" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s an article</a> that explains how and why you may want to do this. Please note that sitters in Canada will continue to list their services and be paid out in Canadian funds.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Does Rover offer an insurance policy similar to DogVacay?
									</strong>
									Yes! Safety is Rover&rsquo;s #1 priority. Every booking made through Rover is covered by premium insurance. You can learn more about the premium insurance included with every Rover booking <a href="https://www.rover.com/insurance/" target="_blank">here</a>.
									<br><br>
									Bookings made on DogVacay will continue to follow DogVacay insurance policies.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What happens to my cancellation policy?
									</strong>
									Similar to DogVacay, Rover allows sitters to choose their own cancellation policies, but there are slight differences. When you migrate your profile, you&rsquo;ll be automatically opted into the Rover cancellation policy that&rsquo;s most similar to your DogVacay one. We encourage you to review Rover&rsquo;s cancellation policy definitions <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/201173720-What-are-the-sitter-cancellation-policies-" target="_blank">here</a> and adjust yours as you see fit.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Are my booking confirmation numbers going to stay the same?
									</strong>
									Yes. Rover support agents will be able to reference bookings with confirmation numbers from the DogVacay platform.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Will I get enough business on the Rover platform?
									</strong>
									All DogVacay pet owners are being welcomed to the Rover community, so you&rsquo;ll be exposed to even more potential customers. By combining resources, we&rsquo;ll be able to invest more in our sitter community—from advertising and growing our customer base, to adopting new technologies that&rsquo;ll help you run your business—which means more bookings for you.

									<strong>
										How do I migrate my customers?
									</strong>
									We&rsquo;ve notified your customers and provided them with the tools they&rsquo;ll need to migrate their profiles to Rover. Once you&rsquo;ve migrated your Rover profile, we&rsquo;ll let your customers know that they can contact you on Rover.
									<br><br>
									We encourage you to stay in contact with your customers as you migrate. Our goal is to make sure that all of your customers migrate to Rover and continue booking with you!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What should I tell my customers?
									</strong>
									We recommend sending them a link to your new Rover profile through your inbox. You can let them know they can message and book with you just as they did on DogVacay once they move their profile to Rover. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										What happens with my customer&rsquo;s site fees?
									</strong>
									Similar to your sitter fee, if your customers have different fee rates on DogVacay and Rover, they will keep the <b>lower</b> of the two rates upon migrating to Rover. If not, they&rsquo;ll keep their current fee rate.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Will customers be covered by insurance once they migrate their profile and begin booking on Rover?
									</strong>
									Yes! Safety is Rover&rsquo;s #1 priority. Every booking made through Rover is covered by premium insurance. When your customers are away, they can feel secure in the knowledge that their pet&rsquo;s health and wellness are covered. You can learn more about the premium insurance included with every Rover booking <a href="https://www.rover.com/insurance/" target="_blank">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How do repeat customers find me, message me, and book with me?
									</strong>
									We&rsquo;re ensuring that you will never lose touch with your repeat customers. You can find your complete message history with your DogVacay repeat customers on your new Rover profile. Customers will be able to message you from their existing DogVacay profile before they migrate and from their new Rover profile after they migrate.
									<br><br>
									Customers will be able to book with you on either platform until June 12. After June 12 they&rsquo;ll only be able to book with you on Rover.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How do new customers book with me?
									</strong>
									Once you migrate, your profile will appear in Rover search results. You can also share your Rover profile URL with potential customers. To contact you, new customers will send you a booking request. 
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 id="dv-question-8">
								 When must I migrate?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>

									<strong>
										What are the first things I should do when I migrate my profile to Rover?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Double check your profile, including the services that you offer, your rates, your booking preferences, your cancellation policy, and your calendar availability. Feel free to adjust your new profile as you see fit</li>
									<li>With Rover&rsquo;s calendar, you can set availability per service. <a href="https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/206004606-How-do-I-manage-my-calendar-" target="_blank">This article</a> provides information on how to do so</li>
									<li>Reach out to past customers via your inbox and let them know that they can start booking you on Rover</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Can I close my DogVacay account once I migrate?
									</strong>
									Yes, if you want to close your DogVacay account, you can contact our customer care team at <a href="mailto:help@dogvacay.com">help@dogvacay.com</a>.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 id="dv-question-10">
								 What if I use my profile as an owner?
							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>
									Migrating your DogVacay profile will also transfer your owner history from DogVacay. You can continue to use your new Rover profile as a sitter or an owner, just as you did on DogVacay.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 id="dv-question-11">
								 How do I use Rover?

							</h3>
							<div>
								<p>

									<strong>
										What happens with my customer&rsquo;s site fees?
									</strong>
									Similar to your sitter fee, if your customers have different fee rates on DogVacay and Rover, they will keep the <b>lower</b> of the two rates upon migrating to Rover. If not, they&rsquo;ll keep their current fee rate.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Will customers be covered by insurance once they migrate their profile and begin booking on Rover?
									</strong>
									Yes! Safety is Rover&rsquo;s #1 priority. Every booking made through Rover is covered by premium insurance. When your customers are away, they can feel secure in the knowledge that their pet&rsquo;s health and wellness are covered. You can learn more about the premium insurance included with every Rover booking <a href="https://www.rover.com/insurance/" target="_blank">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How do repeat customers from DogVacay find me, message me, and book with me?
									</strong>
									We&rsquo;re ensuring that you will never lose touch with your repeat customers. You can find your complete message history with your DogVacay repeat customers on your new Rover profile. Customers will be able to message you from their existing DogVacay profile before they migrate and from their new Rover profile after they migrate.
									<br><br>
									Customers will be able to book with you on either platform until June 12. After June 12 they&rsquo;ll only be able to book with you on Rover.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										How do new customers book with me?
									</strong>
									Your profile will continue to appear in Rover search results. You can also share your Rover profile URL with potential customers.

				<p>
					<strong>What is happening with DogVacay and Rover?</strong>
					On May 1, all United States DogVacay hosts and sitters were invited to migrate their profiles to Rover, which can be done with just a few clicks. You&rsquo;ll still be able to manage existing bookings on DogVacay, but we encourage you to manage your business on Rover—that way, all your info will live in one place. After June 12, you can continue creating new bookings on Rover, but you will no longer be able to create new bookings on DogVacay and will be redirected to complete the booking on Rover.

							Why are DogVacay and Rover coming together?
						</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								Rover and DogVacay share the same mission: To make life better for dogs and the people who love them. We can make an even bigger impact together. This union will make it easier for pet parents to get trusted care for their dogs, for pet sitters to connect with more dog owners nationwide, and most importantly, for dogs to get the best neighborhood care.

As a Rover sitter, you&rsquo;ll still be able to choose your schedule, services, and rates, and continue to build your own pet-sitting business.

								<strong>
									What does &ldquo;migrating to Rover&rdquo; mean?
								</strong>
								Migrating to Rover is the quick and easy process of activating your Rover account, which transfers your DogVacay account to Rover. Activating your account transfers your DogVacay account info, messages, and your past, current, and future bookings to the Rover platform.
								<br><br>
								<b>If you already have a Rover account:</b> When you activate your account, your DogVacay messages and bookings (past, current, and future) will be transferred to your existing Rover account.
								<br><br>
								<b>If you don&rsquo;t already have a Rover account:</b> When you activate your new Rover account, it&rsquo;ll have all the information from your DogVacay account along with your DogVacay messages and bookings (past, current, and future).
